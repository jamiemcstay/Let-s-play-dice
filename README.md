# Let's Play Dice

## A dice rolling game

>Let's play dice is a digital version of the dice rolling game known commonly as Cee-lo. Cee-lo can be played with 2 or more players who bet on rounds to roll the better dice combinations.

### Setup

>Each player rolls a single dice, the player who rolls the highest number is the banker, who gets to set the stakes for the first round. Each player has a bankroll of $500. 
 

### Dice combinations

> Instant Win: 4-5-6, three-of-a-kind, Pair+6

> Instant Loss: 1-2-3, Pair + 1

> Set point: Pair + 2, Pair + 3, Pair + 4 Pair + 5

### Gameplay 

> The Banker is the first to roll three dice, with the aim to roll a winning combination of set point. 

> If the banker rolls a instant win combination, they win all the bets made.

> If the banker rolls an instant loss combination, they lose all the bets made.

> If the banker rolls a set point, the other player gets a turn to roll three dice. If the player get an instant win combination or higher point they win all the bets.

> The winner of the round is the banker in the next round and gets to set the stakes. 

> Gameplay continues until either players bankroll is at $0.

## UX 

<a name="ux"></a>

### Project research

> For project two I wanted to pick something a little bit different. After some consideration I settled on Cee-lo, as it is a game I used to play with friends a lot and it is a lot of fun, and I thought it would be a good challenge.

### UX Design

#### Color

As Cee-lo is a simple game, I wanted to keep the color minimal, and when designing in figma I really liked the simplicity of the black, white and grey colors, so I decided to keep these. 

#### Font 

For the font I chose jetBrains mono, as its clear with distinct characters and is sufficient in updating the user as to gameflow and information.

## User Stories

> As a user I want a fun game to play.
> As a user I want a gambling game.
> As a user I want to be able to understand whats happening and the game progresses.
> As a user I want to be able to see my assets, in the form of my score and my bank roll. 
> As a user I want to be able to continue to the play the game until I close down the page.
